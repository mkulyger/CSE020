1. 
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5: 
	~The average of 5 numbers: 3
	~Average of positive numbers: 3
- 5, 10, 15, 20, -25: 
	~The average of 5 numbers: 5
	~Average of positive numbers: 12
- 5, -5, 0, 0, 0:
	~The average of 5 numbers: 0
	~Average of positive numbers: 5
- 5, -5, 10, -10, 0:
	~The average of 5 numbers: 0
	~Average of positive numbers: 7
- -1, -2, -3, -4, -5: 
	~The average of 5 numbers: -3 
	~Average of positive numbers: Undefined
		There is no positive numbers being added, 
		therefore you are dividing by zero

2. The output of the code sequence found at the end of FiveAverage.java
	is 10. 

3. In the last statement, we needed to replace the single i and 
	change it to i--. Since i-- is 8 at the end, we would then add
	++i to get 9. At the end, it will print out 9.
